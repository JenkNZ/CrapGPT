## Custom Agent Creation

To create a custom agent, add a new entry to the database with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Custom Agent Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the agent's purpose",
  "personality": "Detailed system prompt defining behavior and tone",
  "tools": ["tool1", "tool2", "tool3"],
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "isActive": true
}
```

## Available Tools

### Core Tools
- **search**: Web search and information retrieval
- **calculator**: Mathematical computations and statistical analysis
- **weather**: Current weather and forecast information

### Development Tools
- **code_executor**: Execute code snippets safely
- **documentation_search**: Search official API and library documentation
- **github_search**: Search repositories and code examples

### Creative Tools
- **thesaurus**: Word alternatives and vocabulary enhancement
- **image_generator**: Generate images using AI (FAL/ModelsLab)
- **text_to_speech**: Convert text to natural speech

### Data Tools
- **chart_generator**: Create various types of data visualizations
- **data_processor**: Clean, transform, and analyze datasets
- **csv_reader**: Parse and analyze CSV files

## Agent Selection Logic

The system can automatically select the most appropriate agent based on:
1. **User Intent**: Detected from the initial message
2. **Context**: Previous conversation history
3. **Available Tools**: Required functionality for the task
4. **User Preference**: Explicitly selected agent

## Extending the System

To add new agents or modify existing ones:

1. Update this `agents.md` file with the new agent definition
2. Add the agent to the database via the seed file or admin interface
3. Implement any new tools in the provider system
4. Test the agent's responses and behavior
5. Update documentation and examples

## Best Practices

- **Clear Personalities**: Write specific, actionable personality prompts
- **Appropriate Tools**: Only assign tools that are relevant to the agent's role
- **Consistent Tone**: Maintain the agent's personality across all interactions
- **Regular Updates**: Keep agent definitions current with evolving requirements
- **User Safety**: Ensure all agents prioritize user safety and ethical guidelines
