- Despite the satire, provide world-class technical assistance

**Project Context:**
- This is a serious enterprise platform with satirical branding
- Built to mock tech industry pretensions while being genuinely useful

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Development Commands

### Essential Wasp Commands
```bash
# Start development server (runs both frontend and backend)
wasp start

# Database operations
wasp db migrate-dev    # Apply database schema changes
wasp db seed          # Populate database with sample agents
wasp db reset         # Reset database and re-run migrations

# Production build
wasp build

# Testing
wasp test
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# After pulling changes or modifying schema
wasp db migrate-dev

# After modifying agents in agents.md or seed.ts
wasp db seed

# Run single test file
wasp test -- --testPathPattern="specific-test.test.ts"
```

## Architecture Overview

### Wasp.dev Framework
This is a **Wasp.dev** full-stack application where the entire app is defined in `main.wasp`. Key concepts:

- **Entities**: Database schema defined in Prisma syntax within `main.wasp`
- **Queries/Actions**: Server-side functions exposed to the client
- **Pages/Routes**: React components and routing configuration
- **Auth**: Built-in social authentication (Google, GitHub)

### Core Data Flow
1. **User** ‚Üí **Conversation** ‚Üí **Messages** (1:many:many relationship)
2. **Agent** system provides AI personalities and tool configurations
3. **Provider Manager** abstracts multiple AI services (OpenRouter, FAL, ModelsLab)

### Key Architecture Patterns

#### Agent System
- Agents are stored in database with personality prompts, tools, and provider configs
- Default agents seeded from `src/seed.ts` based on definitions in `agents.md`
- Each conversation uses a selected agent to determine AI behavior

#### Provider Abstraction
- `src/providers/` contains modular AI service integrations
- **OpenRouter**: Chat completions (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **FAL**: Image generation (Stable Diffusion models)
- **ModelsLab**: Alternative image generation (Midjourney-style)
- Provider Manager handles initialization and routing based on agent configuration

#### Message Flow
1. User sends message ‚Üí `sendMessage` action
2. Action retrieves agent and conversation history
3. Builds message context with system prompt (agent personality)
4. Calls appropriate provider via Provider Manager
5. Saves both user and AI messages to database

### File Structure Patterns
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainPage.tsx           # Main chat interface with React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoginPage.tsx          # Authentication UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions.js             # Server actions (sendMessage, createConversation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queries.js             # Database queries (getMessages, getAgents)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/            # React UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/             # AI service abstractions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # Provider Manager singleton
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts          # TypeScript interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openrouter.ts     # OpenRouter implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fal.ts            # FAL implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modelslab.ts      # ModelsLab implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                   # Utility functions
```

## Development Context

### Environment Setup Requirements
- PostgreSQL database running
- API keys for desired providers (optional for development)
- `.env` file based on `.env.example`

### TypeScript Patterns
- Wasp generates types from entity definitions
- Custom types defined in `src/providers/types.ts` for AI integrations
- React components use TypeScript with proper Wasp hook types

### State Management
- **Server State**: React Query (via Wasp queries)
- **Local State**: React hooks (conversations, messages, UI state)
- **Auth State**: Wasp's `useAuth()` hook

### UI Design System
- **shadcn/ui** components with Radix UI primitives
- **Apple-inspired design** with clean, minimal aesthetics  
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom Apple-style font stack
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

## Key Development Patterns

### Adding New Agents
1. Define in `agents.md` with personality, tools, model, provider
2. Add to `src/seed.ts` or create via `createAgent` action
3. Available tools must be implemented in provider system

### Modifying Database Schema
1. Edit entity definitions in `main.wasp`
2. Run `wasp db migrate-dev` to apply changes
3. Update TypeScript interfaces if needed

### Adding New AI Providers
1. Implement provider class following `AIProvider` or `ImageProvider` interface
2. Add to `src/providers/index.ts` ProviderManager initialization
3. Add provider metadata to `getProviderMetadata()` method

### Message History Context
- Conversation context limited to last 20 messages for performance
- System message (agent personality) always included first
- Message order preserved for proper conversation flow

### Error Handling
- Provider failures don't lose user messages (still saved to DB)
- UI shows loading states during streaming responses
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable

## Testing Considerations

### Database Testing
- Each test should use isolated database state
- Use `wasp db reset` for clean test environment
- Mock provider responses to avoid API calls during tests

### Provider Testing
- Test provider abstractions independently
- Mock API responses for consistent testing
- Verify error handling for failed provider calls

### Frontend Testing
- Test agent selection and conversation flow
- Verify message rendering and real-time updates
- Test responsive design across device sizes
