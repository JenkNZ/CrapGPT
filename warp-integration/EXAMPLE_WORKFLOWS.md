## ðŸŽ¨ Model Selection Intelligence

### OpenRouter Model Optimization

**Task Type Analysis â†’ Model Selection:**

```typescript
// Example: AgentForge's model selection logic
const modelSelection = {
  // Complex reasoning and analysis
  researchTasks: {
    primary: "anthropic/claude-3-opus",
    secondary: "openai/gpt-4-turbo", 
    fallback: "google/gemini-pro-1.5"
  },
  
  // Code generation and debugging
  developmentTasks: {
    primary: "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    secondary: "openai/gpt-4-turbo",
    fallback: "meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b"
  },
  
  // Fast responses and simple queries
  quickTasks: {
    primary: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
    secondary: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
    fallback: "meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b"
  },
  
  // Cost-optimized for bulk operations
  batchTasks: {
    primary: "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b",
